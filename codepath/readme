function folder contains the called functions in the figure script.

% f1_ab.m and f1_cd.m contains a demo script showing how to visualize the biomass/disturbance 
   map and fit the recovery curve in a 1°x1° grid and calculate the recovery time
   
% f2_ac.m and f2_dg.m contains a script to compare with site data and visualize the spatial distribution of the 
   asymptotic AGB (AGBmax) and the recovery time. 

% f3_sample.m contains a demo of how to visualize the annual c change for one region. 

% f4.m describes how to use demo_f4 data to calculate the c change and legacy c changes 
   for different components in fig. 4
