This repository contains the data and code produced for the following paper:

Title: Biomass recovery after fires dominates the carbon sink of boreal forests over the last three decades

In this projects, most of the image preprocessing, data analysis and visualization was carried out in matlab 2021a. 

This repository contains the source data and the scripts to produce the main figures.

The demo data used to produce the main figures are saved in data_folder.
The codepath folder contain the scripts (codepath/fig) and the required functions (codepath/function) to do the data preprocessing/plot the figures.
