Title: Biomass recovery after fires dominates the carbon sink of boreal forests over the last three decades

In this projects, most of the image preprocessing, data analysis and visualization was carried out in matlab 2021a. 

This repository contains the source data and the scripts to produce the main figures.

The demo data used to produce the main figures were saved in data_folder.
The code packages contain the scripts (codepath/fig) and the required functions (codepath/function) to make the figures/do the data preprocessing.
